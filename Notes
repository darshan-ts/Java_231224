=============
Variables
=============
1.Local variable
======================
Variable declare within a method called local variable

Scope: within method
memory allocation: at the time of method execution
memory deallocated: after execution of method

2.Instance variable
=========================
Any variable declare inside class and outside any method/block and without static keyword
is called instance variable

Scope: Within object
memory allocation: at the time of object creation
memory deallocated: after execution of object/destroy any object

for every new object new memory will be created

3.static variable
=========================
Any variable declare inside class and outside any method/block and with static keyword
is called static  variable
any data common for all the objects, then such data we can declare as static. Unnecessarily we don't create static variable.
No object required to call static data/method

Scope: Within class
memory allocation: at the time of class loading
memory deallocated: after execution of class

for every new object same memory will be shared

static keyword plays important role it is used for memory management
-------------------------------------------
static variable
static method


static block
===================
It is used to initialize static variable 
first priority to static block

Type Casting
=================
One data type we convert into other data type

1.Primitive to primitive
----------------------------
	1.Implicit
	2.Explicit
	
	
Implicit(Automatic conversion taken care by JVM)
-----------------------------------------------------
small size---->large size

byte--->short--->int--->long--->float-->double

Explicit(Manual conversion)here we use casting operator
-----------------------------------------------------------
large size--->small size 

============================================
Super Keyword
============================
1.Super keyword can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2.Super keyword can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3.Super keyword can be used to call immediate parent class constructor.(super())

final Keyword
======================================
final keyword can be apply for variable,method and class
1.If we apply final keyword to variable then that variable will be consider constant variable
(value will become fix...no one can update)
2.If we apply final keyword to method then we cant override that method in other class or child class
3.If we apply final keyword to class then we can not extend that class into another class.
===============================================================
IQ: How we can implement immutable class ,variable or method in java?
Ans: Using final keyword.
==============================================================

Data Abstraction
================
It is process of hiding implementation details of software from end user.

Abstraction achive using
------------------------------
1.Abstarct class
2.Interface

1.Abstarct class
===============
1.In abstract class we can have both abstract method and non abstarct (concreate) Methods.
2.Abstract method and class we can declare using abstract keyword.
3.Abstract class can not be instantiated.
4.Abstract methods must be overriden by class which inherits abstract class.
5.Using Abstract class partial abstraction is possible.

Interface
===========
1.An�interface in java�is a blueprint of a class. 
2.Interface contains final and static variables.
3.Interface contains abstract methods.
4.An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5.Methods in interface are public by default.
6.Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7.We can define interface with interface keyword.
8.A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface
 but a�class implements an interface.
9.We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
10.Inheritance use extends keyword and Interface use implements keyword.
